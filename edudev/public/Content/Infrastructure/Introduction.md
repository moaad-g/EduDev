    What is Infrastructure?
</p>

<p className="my-5">
    Infrastructure, in the context of Computer Science and DevOps, is the framework of components that enable the operation of digital services, apps and processes. It serves as the underlying backbone upon which various IT services and solutions are built, deployed, and managed. Infrastructure is composed of many elements, hardware, software, physical buildings etc. There are also two types of infrastructure, both of which will be covered in this course; On Premises and Cloud infrastructure.

So what does this mean, what do all these things do? Well traditionally the app development teams and operation teams were seperate. The app teams would often hand off their code to the operation teams when it was completed and only see it again when it needed changing. DevOps changes this, a DevOps engineer/team will not only write the code but also deploy,maintain and monitor it. simple!
