    What is DevOps?
</p>

<p className="my-5">
    DevOps is well, it's not entirely clear. A methodology? a philosophy? a software trend? all of the above? There isn't a clear and unanimous definintion so the first thing we'll do is define it.
</p>


**Definition**: DevOps is a methodology which accelerates the speed of app deployment maintenance.

We will also use amazon's definition of DevOps best practices to further break down the elements which make up DevOps:
<ol>
    <li>- CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Delivery)
    <li>- Infrastucture As Code
    <li>- Monitoring
    <li>- Collaboration
    <li>- Microservices
<ol>

<p className="m-10"><p>
So what does this mean, what do all these things do? Well traditionally the app development teams and operation teams were seperate. The app teams would often hand off their code to the operation teams when it was completed and only see it again when it needed changing. DevOps changes this, a DevOps engineer/team will not only write the code but also deploy,maintain and monitor it. simple!
