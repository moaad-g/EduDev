    So...What is EduDev?
</p>

EduDev is a platform where **you** will get an introduction to DevOps
<p className="m-5"></p>
So wo are you?  Ideally you are a Computer Science student , or anyone with a background in tech. EduDev will not teach general software development, coding, data structures or any of that other (not so) fun stuff.
<p className="m-10"></p>
EduDev will teach you in 3 ways.
<p className="m-3"><p>
Firstly, regular course content, pages like this. where you can read, watch and learn the basic concepts.
<p className="m-3"><p>
Secondly, Quizzes, you probably saw the quizzes tab on the topic page and hopefully clicked this first (if you didnt no worries). Quizzes are designed alongside the course content but you are not required to do them in any particular order (this is a feature, not a bug).
<p className="m-3"><p>
Finally, The Sandbox. This will be where you can visualise all the concepts we discuss over the courses, creating your own network of personal and enterprise computers and creating connections between them.
<p className="m-10"></p>
